# vRealize Operations Manager Dashboard - WCP namespace resource overview
Released in 2020 by Dominik Zorgnotti under MIT license

## Changelog
2020-04-27 - v1.1: Added more custom views to analyze Tanzu Kubernets Cluster resource usage

## How to import 
1. Import the Views
2. Import the Dashboard

## Reason
Once a cluster is enabled with the Workload Platform, you may want to identify the resource demand created by vSphere pods and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters in your vSphere infrastructure. 
Kudos to Christian Dickmann, his request triggered the idea to build this dashboard.

## What the Dashboard shows
This dashboard show you the resource usage starting from namespaces down to pods. 
It uses the "Relationships" from the "Workload Management Inventory" dashboard to get a similar look and feel.

## How to use the Dashboard
Start by selecting your WCP-enabled vSphere cluster, then drill down to namespaces, pods and Tanzu Kubernetes cluster.

## Disclaimer
This dashboard was build and tested with vRealize Operations 8.1.
