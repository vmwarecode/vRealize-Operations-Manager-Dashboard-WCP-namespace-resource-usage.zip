Released in 2020 by Dominik Zorgnotti under MIT license

## How to import 
1. Import the View
2. Import the Dashboard

## Reason
Once a cluster is enabled with the Workload Platform, you may want to identify the resource demand created by vSphere pods and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters in your vSphere infrastructure. 
Kudos to Christian Dickmann, his request triggered the idea to build this dashboard.

## What the Dashboard shows
This dashboard show you the resource usage starting from namespaces down to pods. 
It uses the "Relationships" from the "Workload Management Inventory" dashboard to get a similar look and feel.

## How to use the Dashboard
Start by selecting your WCP-enabled vSphere cluster, then drill down to namespaces and pods.

## Disclaimer
This dashboard was build with vRealize Operations 8.1. It is an early v1 version but should get the job done!
